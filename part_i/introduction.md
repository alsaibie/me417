@def title = "Part I Introduction to Feedback Control"

## Part I - Introduction to Feedback Control
This part reviews the component of feedback control system design, with a refreshing on modeling mechanical and electromechanical systems. The transfer function is introduced as well as the concept of stability, transient response and steady-state responses. 

This part covers the basics needed to understand the tools of control system design. The part is immediately followed by introducing the classical control design approach of root-locus.
