## Introduction
In this lecture, we introduce the concept of state-space controller design. We discuss the full state feedback controller and carryout a couple of examples of full state feedback controller design via pole placement. 

We also discuss how to place additional poles for higher order systems to achieve a desired transient response. 

The concept of controllability is also introduced, and we also compare the full state feedback controller with a standard proportional controller.
