# Numerical Lessons - MATLAB

\toc

## Lesson 1 - System Response and Numerical Integration
This lesson is an introduction to Simulation of Dynamical Systems, through the use of built-in functions as well as by applying basic numerical integration techniques. The goal of this lesson is to set the structure in place for applying feedback control on both linear and non-linear systems.

## Lesson 2 - Feedback Control and PID Tuning
Building on material from Lesson 1, feedback control is introduced in the context of tool-boxes built-in function and through numerical integration. Transient and steady-state response is observed by manual tuning of PID controller gains.

## Lesson 3 - Root-Locus Controller Design
This lesson showcases the way a controller is designed using pole placement and root-locus. The controller design in the root-locus is implemented back into closed-loop simulation of the system.

## Lesson 4 - State-Space Controller Design
Multi-Input Multi-Output Systems are discussed and a full-state feedback controller as well as an LQR design example is given. The controllers are applied on a crane system and an inverted pendulum on a cart.
