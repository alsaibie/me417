# ME 417 Control of Mechanical Systems

<!-- \tableofcontents -->

This is a senior level course in the subject of control of mechanical systems. The course covers the fundamentals of feedback control, focusing on the design of control systems through the graphical techniques of Root-locus and Bode plots. The course also introduces students to control design via State-Space.

## Class Lectures
Lecture Notes and videos (planned) can be found listed on the site navigation bar.

## [Numerical Lessons](numerical_lessons/index.html)
The course gives a strong emphasis on applying control system theory numerically, through the use of built-in functions and bare-method simulations. 

The lessons are provided for MATLAB (and planned for JuliaLang)
